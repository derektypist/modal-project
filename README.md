# Modal Project

The purpose of the project is to provide a modal using plain JavaScript without using frameworks.  However, Google Fonts (e.g. to use Font Roboto) and Font Awesome will be used.

## UX

As a user, when I click on the button with Open Modal, I expect modal content to be displayed.

As a user, when the modal content is displayed and I hover over the times button (x), the size changes as well as the color.

As a user, when the modal content is displayed and I click on the times button, the modal content is hidden.
